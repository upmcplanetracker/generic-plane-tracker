## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you may find.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as quickly as possible. **Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please send an email to:

**[upmcplanetracker@gmail.com](mailto:upmcplanetracker@gmail.com)**

Or, if you prefer, you can use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
1. Go to the **Security tab** of this repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the form with the details of the vulnerability.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us quickly understand and resolve the issue, please include the following information in your report:

* **Description:** A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
* **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to reliably reproduce the vulnerability. This is crucial for us to verify and fix the issue.
    * Include any specific configuration, operating system, or dependencies needed.
    * If applicable, provide code snippets, commands, or network requests.
* **Impact:** Explain the potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, unauthorized access, denial of service).
* **Affected Versions:** Specify which versions or commits of the project are affected.
* **Your Contact Information (Optional but Recommended):** Your name, email, or other preferred contact method so we can communicate with you.

### Our Commitment

* We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **2 business days**.
* We will provide an estimated timeline for resolution (if possible) after initial assessment.
* We will keep you informed of our progress.
* We will notify you once the vulnerability is resolved.
* We will acknowledge your contribution in our release notes or a dedicated security advisory, if you wish.

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you:
* Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been fixed.
* Avoid accessing or modifying user data beyond what is necessary to prove the vulnerability.
* Do not disrupt or degrade our services during your testing.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!
